                <p class="txt"><b>Florida</b>, constituent state of the United States of America. 
                    Geographic location has been the key factor in Florida’s long and colourful 
                    development, and it helps explain the striking contemporary character of the 
                    state. The greater part of Florida lies on a peninsula that protrudes southeastward 
                    from the North American continent, separating the waters of the Atlantic Ocean from 
                    those of the Gulf of Mexico and pointing toward Cuba and the Caribbean Sea beyond.

                <h3 class="txt">Drainage and soils</h3>
                <p class="txt">The flat Florida landscape is covered by a latticework of some 1,700 streams
                    (mostly in the north and northwest) and tens of thousands of lakes (mostly in the central 
                    region). The state also contains a significant portion of the country’s first-magnitude
                    artesian springs, most located in the central region. In general, Florida’s soils consist
                    of sand, sandy loam, clay, peat, and muck, but more than 300 soil types have been mapped.

                <p class="txt">Climatically, Florida is divided into two regions. The tropical zone lies generally
                    south of a west-east line drawn from Bradenton along the south shore of Lake Okeechobee to
                    Vero Beach, while north of this line the state is subtropical. Summers are uniform throughout
                    Florida. Freezing weather of short duration (but often crippling to agriculture) can occur
                    as far south as Miami, but the Keys have never had frost.

                <h3 class="txt">Relief</h3>
                <p class="txt">Florida is a geologically young, low-lying plain, mostly less than 100 feet
                    (30 metres) above sea level. The highest point is near the Alabama border in Walton county,
                    a mere 345 feet (105 metres) above sea level. Sedimentary deposits of sand and limestone
                    cover most of the state, with areas of peat and muck marking locations where freshwater
                    bodies once stood. The contemporary topography has been largely molded by running water,
                    waves, ocean currents, winds, changes in sea level, and the wearing away of limestone
                    rocks by solution. <p class="link">https://www.britannica.com/</p>

            <p>It is popularly known as a “sea cow.” It is the largest surviving member of the aquatic 
                mammal order Sirenia. Primarily located along the coasts of Florida but can extend as 
                far west as Texas and as far north as Massachusetts. On the endangered animals in Florida 
                list because of loss of warm-water habitat, collisions with watercraft, red tide, high 
                perinatal mortality, and illegal hunting.

            <p>This critically endangered sawfish is in the family Pristidae. Habitat is in shallow tropical and 
                subtropical waters in the coastal Atlantic. Extremely vulnerable because of overexploitation, 
                restricted habitat, the tendency of getting caught in nets, and low population growth.

            <p>It is the size of a cardinal, about 7 inches long. Its unique feature is a black cap and 
                nape that encircle white cheek patches. The male woodpecker has a small red streak on each 
                side of the black cap called a cockade. They prefer longleaf pines. Because the longleaf 
                pine ecosystem has disappeared from much of its original range, it has caused this bird 
                to become endangered.

                rock lands, and beachside scrub areas. This butterfly had been known on the mainland but disappeared 
                by the 1980s.

                Florida state animal. Its diet consists of small animals such as mice, rabbits, and waterfowl. 
                It also stalks larger prey, such as white-tailed deer, feral pigs, and storks.

                    sweet gum, tulip (yellow poplar), magnolia, and hickory are common in the north.

                    are protected. About 100 species of mammals are found in the state, including deer, pumas, 
                    bobcats, boars, black bears, armadillos, otters, mink, and gray foxes; smaller animals are also 
                    numerous. Manatees are found along the coast and in warm inland waters, and several species of 
                    porpoises and dolphins lend their distinctive character to the clear coastal waters.
